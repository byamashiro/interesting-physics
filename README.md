This contains the source code for the Book of Interesting Physics.


#The Goal
There exists a large body of physics literature, both text books and 
popular accounts, however in popular accounts there are often no problems,
or when they are presented are worked out, while in text books there 
are too many problems that stress arithmetic and remembering the formulas
rather than illustrating fundamental concepts and solidifying intuition.
We wish to make a collection of these problems.

However, there are also just fun problems as well as interesting ones that
don't quite contribute to intuition but illustrate the scales of things,
for example, precisely how much energy the sun produces compared to how much
we consume, or how light radiation pressure is compared to the weight of a 
feather.

Beyond that, we can make a third section, beyond the intuition building, and 
the interesting problems, for problems that are computationally intensive 
and show the limits of analytical solutions in physics. For each of these we'll
have a folder
